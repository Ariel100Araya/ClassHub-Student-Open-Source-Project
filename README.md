# ClassHub-Student-Open-Source-Project
This is the open source repository for ClassHub student, a Swift and SwiftUI based Learning Management System. 

## What is it
I bit off a bit more I can chew for a Mass Communications class and ended up having to make a better Blackboard, this is the result of that.

You can read more about it here: https://classhub-by-ariel.my.canva.site/

## How to build (if you're not boring)
Step zero: Be a human being (or a robot, I don't mind)

Step one: Download the code by pressing the code drop down (it should be green, if you see it as yellow, brown, or gray, you should get tested for colorblindness)

Step two: Double click the xcodeproj file in the folder ClassHub Student, if you are a robot, check your manual for what equates to double clicking

Step three: Go to the info tab for the project and change the "Team" from my name to whatever team you have in there

Step four: Press the weird looking triangle that has the word run next to it (the play button)

Step five: there is no step five, if you need a step five, go back to step zero you did something wrong

## Firebase Capablilities
This project uses Google Firebase at it's core, it's quite simple to set up since all the code is already there

Go to firebase.google.com, and make a new project called whatever you'd like, next go to add app and iOS, then get the file Google-ServiceInfo.plist and drag it onto the project

For this project you want to activate Realtime Database and Authentication (using email and password)

And when you build again, you're connected!

## License
This project is based on the Apache 2.0 License, you can see more info about it in the LICENCE file. But as a simple TL;DR if you are going to use this for your own projects, feel free to but just mention me somewhere! 

If you like this project and want to use part of it, or just want to talk, shoot me an email at ariel@prettycoolwebsite.com I would love to talk and see how people are using my code!
